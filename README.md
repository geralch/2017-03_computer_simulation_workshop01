Workshop 01 of Class Computer Simulation - March 2017

Questionary
----------------------------

### Generation Pseudo-Random Number 

* Implement the minimum standard generator (GEM), seen in class. Don't use generators provides by the chossen programming language.

### Goodness of fit 

With the GEM crated in the previoud point generate two files:

- GEM1000.txt 1000 generated pseudo-random numbers.
- GEM10000.txt 10000 generated pseudo-random numbers.

* Implement the χ² test and Poker 2 and 3 decimales test with confidence α = 0,1. In the execution the table must be shown, 
where mis indicated:
	* Class
	* EF (Expeted Frequency)
	* OF (Observed Frequency)
	* Error ((EF-OF)²/EF)
Apply to both cases. In total there are 3 tests for 1000 and 10000 data.

2.2. Select another generator: that of your chossen programming language or an external database and Analyze the results by comparing them.
